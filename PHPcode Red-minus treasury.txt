Current code to get currency value to show "Left to go"
$DM_LEFT = sprintf('$%.02f', $row_Recordset1['net'] - $row_Recordset2['value']);


Added Code to change color red for negative not met goal..green for positive met goal!
**Notice that "$0" in the if statement to call for currency value!!
original code had 0 instead of "$0" and just zero calls a plain number NOT currency!!!

if($DM_LEFT <= "$0") $DM_COLOR ='red';
else $DM_COLOR = '#389C38';

Setting $DM_COLOR value(call) in php code i.e. $DM_COLOR = 'red' $DM_COLOR = 'green' 
2 colors for same value(call) you NEED to use IF and ELSE statement!!!!

Then add "style" code to html element that you want to apply $DM_COLOR!!!
$DM_COLOR becomes a value used in a style attribute in html!!!

ie 

<tr class="bold" style="color:$DM_COLOR;">
	<td width="65%" align="left">Left to go:</td>
        <td align="left">$DM_LEFT</td>
</tr>

CHANGED TEXT based on $0 dollar amount of $DM_LEFT

if($DM_LEFT <= "$0") $content .= "Left to go:";
    else $content .= "Goal Met! Thanks!";

If/else statement defining text.. to set text as a called value i.e. $DM_LEFT
text in PHP is $content .= "something"

Then set text in html element i.e. <p>$content</p> 
or in our example
<td>left to go:</td> to <td>$content</td> and $content was defined in PHP code above
$content is called and = "Left to go:" to display in the html element

if/else sets $content to display "Left to go:" if $DM_LEFT <= "$0" and 
else sets $content to display "Goal Met! Thanks!" if $DM_LEFT isn't less than "$0"
